## Neuron tracking

This project was born as the final task during the Intro to Computer Vision course at Skoltech.

Studying images from a confocal microscope, acute brain slices have a tendency to fluctuate, which is why the coordinates of ROI (cells) are unstable. Approximately three-quarter of sessions are accompanied with neurons shifting, therefore there is a high demand to find an approach study every neuron throughout the whole time.

My role was to detect the bodies of neurons and track them throughout the recording time.
